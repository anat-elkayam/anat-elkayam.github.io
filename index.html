  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Anat Elkayam is an interdisciplinary artist based in Vancouver, British Columbia, on the unceded territories of the <em>xʷməθkʷəy̓əm</em> (Musqueam), <em>Skwxwú7mesh</em> (Squamish), and <em>Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh</em> (Tsleil‑Waututh) Nations. Working across sound, sculpture, installation, and performance, Anat explores the intersections between environmental phenomena and technological mediation.</p>
  <p>She holds a BFA from the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem and is currently completing a Bachelor of Media Arts in the New Media + Sound Arts program at Emily Carr University of Art + Design. Her transition from fashion design to contemporary art was prompted by a critical re‑evaluation of the fashion industry's environmental and ethical impacts—a shift that redirected her toward slower, process‑based methods of storytelling through sound and material.</p>
  <p>Anat’s practice often engages with industrial and digital tools in unconventional ways, deliberately misusing machines to generate poetic and intuitive gestures. Rather than aiming for precision or efficiency, she explores how the failure or subversion of a machine’s intended purpose can yield expressive and organic outcomes.</p>
  <p>In one project, Anat repurposed an overlock sewing machine as a dysfunctional knitting device to create masks in fluid, irregular shapes. In another project, she used a high‑powered laser cutter to remove dense amounts of material, harnessing the machine’s precision to create delicately eroded surfaces that resemble the skeletal remains of decaying leaves. These processes reflect her broader interest in the tension between artificial systems and natural forms.</p>
  <p>Her current body of work focuses on the sonic potential of water and its capacity to act as a collaborator in performance and installation. Anat is developing a custom‑built computational system using the Max/MSP programming environment. This system amplifies the sound of water through hydrophones and translates its physical movement into tonal frequencies.</p>
  <p>Inspired by the work of artist and water researcher Veda Austin, Anat investigates the possibility of co‑composing with water, emphasizing its agency and material intelligence. She approaches sound not only as a medium for expression but as a method of listening, attunement, and relationality with the more‑than‑human world.</p>
  <p>Anat’s work is informed by her interest in ecological listening, feminist approaches to technology, and expanded notions of embodiment and collaboration. She draws from Pauline Oliveros’s “deep listening,” Lee Maracle’s land‑based writings, and Dr. Shiv Visvanathan’s concept of “cognitive justice.”</p>
  <p>Her work has been exhibited in student exhibitions at Emily Carr and she has performed at several experimental sound events in Vancouver, including <em>Durations</em>.</p>
